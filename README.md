# fashion-shop
My lecturer Nate has designed an online shop and I have decided to make it a fashion online shop. 

I will create the online shop using the same design provided by Nate. It will consist of an home page, about, shop, blog, lookbook and contact page.

At the end the shop should be functional and perform the duties of an online shop.
